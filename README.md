# Proffesional-Portfolio

## Description

I wanted to get a starter portfolio for myself so I have a semi permanant place to display my work. It is a basic portfolio with a few elements to add a bit of style. With flex boxes I was able to make my page pretty and work for any device from a desktop to a mobile phone. I learned a lot about flex boxes and effects on text and images.
